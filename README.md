# WordPress Website Link

In our project we used aws to create a virtual computer. This will be able to install a web server that handles http requests. 

We created an EC2 instance. This instance uses an elastic IP address. Our remote host is the public Ipv4 address of the EC2 instance we created. Inside this instance, we have a virtual private cloud.

Next to connect to the instance using ssh we used a ssh client called Mobaxterm. In this, we first downloaded our web server, apache. Then we installed php runtime and MySQL connector for php. We also installed our database, MySQL and WordPress.

Then we developed our WordPress site. 

Inside the, Website Link - Next Level Masters.pdf we have included the link of our website.
